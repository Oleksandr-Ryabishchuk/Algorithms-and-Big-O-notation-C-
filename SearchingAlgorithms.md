Searching Algorithms

The simplest searching algorithm with time|space complexity of O(1) can be searching for an element in an array by index or an element in the dictionary by key.

Then, we go with iterative binary search. It has a time complexity of O(log n) because on every iteration number of the input is divided by 2, and a space complexity of O(1) because it has no recursion inside and the call stack contains only one set of variables
